            <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h3>
            <p>I already had a strong background in web development, so my biggest trouble during this assignment
            was trying to get access into the classroom github for some reason it would continally give me generic errors.
            To solve this I googled the error on stackoverflow and found that changing my primary email to my school address
            somehow fixed it.</p>

            <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
            <p>
                I did not learn much from this assignment, because I already knew a good chunk of HTML,CSS, and JS. 
                However I did learn that I needed to add a remote to my github instead of pulling to attach a local directory
                to my master branch in github classroom.

            <h3>What resources were most helpful in completeting this assignment? How did you
                use these resources?</h3>
            <p>
                I found a small comment in stack overflow that was similar to my github problem I needed to,
                to add a remote directory instead of pulling. Other then that one thread I used no other online resources.
